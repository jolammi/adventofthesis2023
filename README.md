# adventofthesis2023
Usually in December I'd give Advent of Code a try, but this year I decided to put the hours into finally finishing my MSc. thesis. For business reasons I can't discuss the contents of the thesis much here. The purpose of this repo is to act as a diary and to nurture the writing motivation in me with some good ol' fear of public humiliation ðŸ™‚

## Starting position when this repo was created, Nov 26 2023
The thesis consists of implementation and thesis document writing based on implementation and literature study. 
- Outline
  - I have a subject for the thesis
  - Main outline of the thesis has been created
    - The thesis scope was narrowed a while ago, the changes need to be made into thesis before continuing
- Implementation  
  - Starting out, some basic ideas about what to do.  
- Thesis document
  - Something has been written under many of the headings, but many headings lack a deeper idea and specifics
  - Literature review is in its infacy
